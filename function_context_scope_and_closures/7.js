// Will the JavaScript garbage collection mechanism garbage collect 
// the array assigned to the variable array after the function pushIt is run on line 10?

function makeArrays() {
  let array = [];

  return () => {
    array.push('');
    return array;
  };
}

const pushIt = makeArrays();
pushIt();
// more code

// No. Since pushIt can be called multiple times, it needs to retain a reference to the array variable in the closure. 
// Since array is never reassigned, every call to pushIt returns a pointer to the same array. 
// The array gets mutated by each invocation, but it's the same array, so it is not eligible for garbage collection.
